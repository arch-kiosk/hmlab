Runs roughly parallel to the antemurale in this area (SU22-H001). \r\r2023 (following full excavation): Linear drystone architectural feature. Northern face consists of 3 courses of large (30-55 cm) with a few medium (10-15 cm) stones interspersed. Many of the stones of the northern face have flat worked faces. Southern face consists of 4 irregular courses of stone. The top course is a mix of large (up to 55 cm) and medium (15-25 cm) stones, while the bottom three courses are composed of medium (15-25 cm) stones with a few in the bottom course reaching 30 cm. The maximum height of the feature is roughly 95 cm and the width is roughly 70-75 cm. The whole feature curves slightly, paralleing the antemurale of the nuraghe.",

The distinction between FA-032 and this locus is somewhat artificial. Both have striated levels of working surfaces, lots of organic material, and ash, though this locus, FA-033, is noticeably less ashy than FA-032. We “pancaked” up the level with the ash, and the new surface we arrived at was designated FA-033. Overall however, their matrices are quite similar.

The mud layer ‘pancakes’ off readily with a trowel, with thickness of roughly 1cm layer. Underneath were concentrations of chaff suggesting that the mud was in fact spread over organic/chaff deposits, as well as having the organics mixed through it. The mud layer includes some ash and charcoal, with particular concentration in the SE and NE. In the SE much charcoal is included. The end point of this locus was found by “pancaking” down just below the ashy matrix in the southeast and north.\r\rMultiple layers of the chaff-rich mud were found above one another, all lifting off readily with a trowel. A somewhat arbitrary locus change was made after the first 1-2 layers were removed (approx. level across locus), and locus FA-033 continues with the same material, but below the ashy lenses above. There is still ash in that locus, but it is less densely packed than in the SE and N sectors of the locus. The change was made once we excavated below the level of the ash on the east side of the unit.\r\rDensely packed ashy, charcoaly, floor surface. Visible in the cut in the middle of the unit. Very ashy with lots of charcoal in SE corner of area exposed by looters and our artificial cut. ",
